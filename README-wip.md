### Who's This Guy? 

Hey there, human! 👋 I’m John, but everyone at work calls me Beta.

I believe it’s just as important to know who Beta is beyond the tech he builds—because, at the end of the day, it’s people who are behind the world’s greatest and most innovative creations. 🤖✨

A few fun facts about me:

* I’m a hardcore fan of science fiction and dystopian stories—yes, I’ve probably read that book you’re thinking of. I’ve devoured almost every Asimov novel and will defend them with sword and shield. 📚🛡️
* I love soundtracks from video games and movies way more than mainstream music. Maybe that’s why I never learned to dance. 🎶🎮🎬
* I’m an adventure junkie! I’ve been lucky enough to visit over 30 countries, snapping amazing photos along the way. I wouldn’t call myself a photographer, but I love wandering with my camera and taking the time to get the perfect shot. 🌍📸
* I wake up every day at 4AM and, like a true early bird, I’m asleep by 8PM. My calendar is my lifeline—I have to write everything down or I’ll forget (too much on my mind, or maybe just a bad memory). ⏰📝

#### What are my life goals? 🎯

* Become a goose farmer before 2040. 🦢🌾

I thrive at the intersection of hardware, software, and operations, constantly navigating the complexities of autonomous systems, robotics integration, and real-time performance optimization. From ensuring seamless deployments to fine-tuning teleoperation and navigation systems, I’m all about transforming challenges into solutions.

Whether collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to address sensor issues or diving into data analytics to improve OKRs, my focus remains on elevating systems to their highest potential. My role is a balance of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and hands-on problem solving, all aimed at pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

I Love to inovate and elevate the future of robotics with great team. 




#### What's my role about? 

#### What is my work's goals?

Have fun and learn measured by:  

* Achive 100% autonomy rate.
* zero interventions or one each 1.000km
* zero accidents or one each 10.000km
* relationships and train the next gen model for autnomous driving. 
* Keep my team updated with the last trends in the robotics industry.

### The Story

COntare esta historia de arriba para abajo, es decir, de lo mas reciente a los mas viejo.

### Estoy bucando algo mas? 

Que ame lo que hago, con lo que los hago y donde lo hago no quiere decir que no este en bsuqueda siempre de mejores cambios y oportunidades. No estoy cerrado a la progreso, pues como la vid amisma estancarse en un solo lugar es morir en la cadena evolutiva, asi que esiempre estare dispuesto a escuchar y explorar oportunidades, iniciativas y negocios en: 

* RObotica en general.
* Autnoamtizacion industrial. 
* Software as a service. 
* Academia.
