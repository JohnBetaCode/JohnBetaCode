</div>

#### **The Programmer**

Let's be real - I'm not going to claim expertise in every framework under the sun. I don't believe in that mythical "unicorn" developer who masters everything like the Avatar. Instead, I'll be transparent about my core competencies and the tools I work with regularly.

* 💻 Languages: C++ (Intermediate - I've shed tears but built robust applications), Python (Extensive experience and strong command).
* 🔧 IDEs: VSCode, Cursor, and any LLM agent essential for rapid prototyping, unit testing, documentation - the essentials since OpenAI revolutionized our world.
* 📈 Data: Core database queries for building reports, dashboards, and metrics. The platform? They're all similar after a few days of learning. Examples: Tableau, Grafana, Google Studio, Looker (Not my favorite).
* 🤖 Robotics Tools: ROS2, ROS, Gazebo, Vriz, and the classic MATLAB (Still relevant?).
* 📚 Libraries: YOLO, OpenCV (I know it inside out), NVIDIA Platforms: Orin, TX2, Xavier.
* 🐳 Containerization & DevOps: Docker, container orchestration, and deployment strategies for scalable robotics applications.
* 🔌 Embedded Systems: Hands-on experience with microcontrollers, real-time systems, and hardware-software integration.
* 🧠 AI & ML: Experience with neural networks, computer vision, and sensor fusion for autonomous systems.
* ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure: GCP services for robotics applications, edge computing, and distributed systems.
* 🏗️ General: Scalable software architectures, application deployment processes, CI/CD automation, unit testing, and all the essential modern development practices.

As they say, seeing is believing. Just visit kiwibot.com or robot.com to see the results of my team's and colleagues' work - and by extension, mine. I take pride in leading a part of this journey and building, alongside amazing people, a robotics platform that collectively travels more than 5 times around the Earth each year.

#### **The Leader: Learn through victories, and also failures**

### What else I have done? 

Here's my journey through almost a decade of innovation, leadership, and technical excellence across diverse projects and industries. 

*It's better reading backwards to follow the natural chronological order of my journey.*

#### Kiwibot (2018 - Present)

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

The call came on a random Tuesday afternoon, completely out of the blue. "Hey John, what are you up to? Come work with us, but it's not an engineering position - it's to be a delivery guy, and maybe something technical will come up. Come and give it a try." My friend's voice carried that infectious enthusiasm that made saying no impossible. And just like that, from one moment to the next, I found myself two days later in a strange country, surrounded by strange people, working on what would become the most defining chapter of my professional life.

When I joined Kiwibot, I started as an operations coordinator - yes, you read that right, nothing technical at all! My days consisted of schlepping robots to locations, deploying them, picking them up, and playing diplomat between kitchens and clients. It was equal parts exhilarating and exhausting because I was juggling this new adventure while maintaining my technical consulting work with other clients during early mornings and late nights. I still don't know how I managed to keep all the balls in the air - I survived on minimal sleep and lost a concerning amount of weight! But after three months of this chaotic dance, I gradually phased out my other commitments until Kiwibot became my sole focus.

The real turning point came when I managed to bridge the gap between operations and engineering. There was some initial friction, but I saw technical challenges that I knew I could solve, and I convinced the engineering team to give me a shot. That's how I transitioned from robot wrangler to actual engineer at Kiwibot, diving into environment classification, sidewalk analysis, and programming solutions that went far beyond basic computer vision.

Years flew by, team members came and went, and through a combination of accumulated experience, built relationships, and being the most senior member, I found myself with an unexpected opportunity: leadership. By 2020, I was facing a completely new challenge that I thought I understood but quickly realized was a whole different beast. I had the vision, but this was a complete career pivot with challenges and solutions that, while not purely technical, would become inseparable from my technical work going forward.

Fast forward to today, and here I am as the Technical Leader in robotics and AI, with deep expertise in autonomous navigation, perception, and real-time systems. As Head of AI & Robotics at Kiwibot, I've led the development and scaling of our complete autonomy stack—sensor fusion, semantic perception (CNNs, Mask R-CNN), ROS2-based planning and control—powering urban delivery robots toward Level 4 autonomy. I manage multidisciplinary engineering teams, drive robust deployment pipelines (C++/Python, ROS), and align technical innovation with business goals to deliver scalable, safe, and efficient robotic systems in real-world environments.

I'm deeply grateful to Kiwibot and its corporate team for providing me with incredible opportunities, teaching me valuable lessons through both successes and challenges, and allowing me to travel the world while working alongside amazing people with whom we've built part of today's technology and are planning tomorrow's innovations.

#### RedKraken (2022 - Present)

My entrepreneurial spirit has never faded, and as someone who's naturally curious and ambitious in the best sense of the word, my business partner and I are constantly seeking to address real needs and solve genuine problems that exist across industries, both large and small. We've worked with companies from LATAM to the EU on various projects that I can't fully disclose due to NDAs, but I'll share some highlights.

One of my favorite projects is a vehicle and pedestrian counting system. You might think, "meh, big deal!"—and you'd be right at first glance. But consider this: scaling that system to handle over 50 cameras, ingesting real-time data into a database, and using it to dynamically price billboard advertising based on real-time audience reach for partners and contractors. Suddenly it's not so "meh" anymore, right? This is exactly what we built at RedKraken—a solid business currently running, generating revenue, and poised to scale to more partners and tackle different types of challenges in the future.

</div>

Our pride and joy, the special project that still hangs on the walls of our studios today, is the Kraken system. This was the prototype that my partner and I started with—we had an absolute blast building everything from hardware and mechanics to software. We celebrated when we successfully extracted water profiles (temperature, acidity, and other parameters) from nearly 50 meters deep with precise measurements, comparing them to much more expensive stations and equipment. The novelty of this system was precisely its low cost and ability to connect to the cloud and transmit data in real-time.

Unfortunately, the system lacked financial support—getting funding in our beautiful country is incredibly challenging. And sadly, in the area where we implemented this, our own system confirmed that the water was somewhat contaminated due to high fish farming activity, hotels, and tourism. Who's going to be interested in jeopardizing what drives commerce, even if it means leaving their children without clean water in the future? That's for the reader to judge.

#### SaaS Companies (2016 - 2018)

We've all been there - that moment when you're staring at the ceiling thinking "what now?" I found myself in that exact position, with no financial support and a growing pile of bills that seemed to multiply overnight. In desperation, I turned to a professor who had become a friend, someone who had evaluated my thesis work. I asked him about any projects or opportunities that would challenge me to create, program, and solve problems using what I knew how to do (computer vision, mostly). Thanks to him, I landed a gig at a company offering software-as-a-service, and I hit it off perfectly with their CTO at the time. I ended up freelancing several projects that today a student could probably knock out in a few hours with some AI agent or GPT - but back then, this was cutting-edge stuff!

There, I had the opportunity to work on training YOLO models for optical character recognition - yes, you read that right! Back then, it wasn't nearly as straightforward as it is now, and the models weren't exactly precise. We wanted to design a system for vehicle diagnostic centers to measure how long the entire vehicle evaluation process took, which required identifying license plates (ALPR) and then character-by-character analysis to trigger a video capture system. I had an absolute blast with this project - from capturing and labeling thousands of images, to training models, to playing around with primitive OpenCV, Dlib, and FFmpeg. Later, I learned that this same system we deployed was used as a service by the traffic department to issue traffic tickets to vehicles that didn't comply with their restriction day. Helping build something to catch traffic violators definitely satisfied a bit of my inner troublemaker! 😈

And of course, there was my entrepreneurial phase! That spirit is still alive, and I know I'll pick it up again someday. It wasn't exactly during these dates, but I tried working with a partner at the time on agricultural projects and university vending machines. But like every story that touches on these themes, my partner left me hanging at one point with several projects ready to launch and money already disbursed from people who trusted us. Some projects that actually saw the light of day included a system for inspecting surgical screws and plates, where we had to categorize and qualify everything from color to characteristics and defects of these components. Other projects also came to life, though they're not quite as cool or relevant to showcase and describe here - some of those repositories are still up on my profile if you want to take a look.

#### Academic Research and Training (Before 2018)

Let me be honest - I wasn't exactly a prodigy in university! I was organized and delivered solid work, but while I wasn't terrible academically, I was far from being the star student. What really defined me was being someone who was extremely, almost obsessively organized with an eye for detail. My university years were a rollercoaster of equal parts joy and struggle. I worked as a teaching assistant and ran several tutoring sessions in electronic circuits, logic circuits, and programming - which probably taught me more than I taught others!

At my university (PUJ-Colombia), I found my tribe in the Robotics group, where we competed in various categories and competitions, both national and international, on the VEX platform. After taking numerous robotics courses and working on various projects like a differential drive cart and a drawing arm, I developed a deep love for creating in robotics that naturally drew me to this group. I still vividly remember the electric excitement of almost winning an international competition when we went head-to-head against what today might be the talent leading robotics in various sectors. Those were the days!

For my undergraduate thesis, I dove deep into computer vision. Back then, there were no programming agents, no ChatGPT, and precious little guidance on these topics, so I had to devour mountains of literature to build an aquaculture net inspection system. The program ran on a UAV (Underwater Vehicle) as part of a thesis that one of my advisors directed for his postdoctoral work, focused on inspecting water quality parameters in aquatic bodies. This work would later continue at Kraken under his permission - full circle moment!

After finishing my undergraduate work and having taken several coterminal or master's level courses in advance, I decided to continue with my master's studies. However, due to personal and economic circumstances at the time, I couldn't complete the final stage. This still weighs on me a bit, but nowadays, given what I do, I question: who the hell cares about another degree? I think experience and knowing how to actually do things matters far more. Anyway, during my university period, I enjoyed it immensely. More than learning what I use today, it was the formation that taught me a methodological process, the rigor and discipline to approach engineering challenges, and it left me with several of my best friends, acquaintances, and advisors that I count on today.
