### Who's This Guy? 

Hey there, human! üëã I'm John, but everyone at work calls me Beta.

I believe it's just as important to know who Beta is beyond the tech he builds‚Äîbecause, at the end of the day, it's people who are behind the world's greatest and most innovative creations. ü§ñ‚ú®

A few fun facts about me:

* I'm a hardcore fan of science fiction and dystopian stories‚Äîyes, I've probably read that book you're thinking of. I've devoured almost every Asimov novel and will defend them with sword and shield. üìöüõ°Ô∏è
* I love soundtracks from video games and movies way more than mainstream music. Maybe that's why I never learned to dance. üé∂üéÆüé¨
* I'm an adventure junkie! I've been lucky enough to visit over 30 countries, snapping amazing photos along the way. I wouldn't call myself a photographer, but I love wandering with my camera and taking the time to get the perfect shot. üåçüì∏
* I wake up every day at 4AM and, like a true early bird, I'm asleep by 8PM. My calendar is my lifeline‚ÄîI have to write everything down or I'll forget (too much on my mind, or maybe just a bad memory). ‚è∞üìù

#### What are my life goals? üéØ

* Become a goose farmer before 2040. ü¶¢üåæ
* Make and unicorn startup/idea have suffering/fun. ü¶Ñüí°

### What's is doing Beta? 

Currently living the technical lead chapter in the role of **Head of Ai&Robotics Department** at robot.com previously aka. Kiwibot

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>

At robot.com I thrive at the intersection of hardware, software, and operations, constantly navigating the complexities of autonomous systems, robotics integration, and real-time performance optimization. From ensuring seamless deployments to fine-tuning teleoperation and navigation systems, I'm all about transforming challenges into solutions.

Whether collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to address sensor issues or diving into data analytics to improve OKRs, my focus remains on elevating systems and people to their highest potential. 

My role is a balance of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and hands-on problem solving, all aimed at pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

I Love to inovate and elevate the future of robotics with great team. 

#### What is my work's goals?

Make the best autnomous driving system for rover, and have fun and learn measured by:  

* Achive 100% autonomy rate.
* zero interventions or one each 1.000km
* zero accidents or one each 10.000km
* relationships and train the next gen model for autnomous driving. 
* Keep my team updated with the last trends in the robotics industry.

#### What are my Skills

I've divided my skills into two verticals since 2020, when my role transitioned into a technical manager position. This was a complete shift in my career, though each aspect has been fundamental to the other, and I face unique challenges in both domains.

##### The Manager 

* Strategic team and priority management aligned with company objectives
* Development of departmental strategies and methodologies to achieve goals (OKRs, KPIs) that align with business objectives
* AI-driven optimization of applications and processes through innovative methodologies
* Continuous team growth through ongoing learning and active participation in the robotics community
* Leadership in fostering innovation and maintaining high-performance standards

Here's my [MManagment style and framework](Management_Notes.md) and [How to work with me](https://github.com/JohnBetaCode/JohnBetaCode/blob/master/How_to_work_with_JohnBetaCode.md).

##### The Programmer

Let's be real - I'm not going to claim expertise in every framework under the sun. I don't believe in that mythical "unicorn" developer who masters everything like the Avatar. Instead, I'll be transparent about my core competencies and the tools I work with regularly.

* Languages: C++ (Intermediate - I've shed tears but built robust applications), Python (Extensive experience and strong command)
* IDEs: VSCode, Cursor, and any LLM agent essential for rapid prototyping, unit testing, documentation - the essentials since OpenAI revolutionized our world
* Data: Core database queries for building reports, dashboards, and metrics. The platform? They're all similar after a few days of learning. Examples: Tableau, Grafana, Google Studio, Looker (Not my favorite)
* Robotics Tools: ROS2, ROS, Gazebo, Vriz, and the classic MATLAB (Still relevant?)
* Libraries: YOLO, OpenCV (I know it inside out), NVIDIA Platforms: Orin, TX2, Xavier
* Containerization & DevOps: Docker, container orchestration, and deployment strategies for scalable robotics applications
* Embedded Systems: Hands-on experience with microcontrollers, real-time systems, and hardware-software integration
* AI & ML: Experience with neural networks, computer vision, and sensor fusion for autonomous systems
* Cloud & Infrastructure: GCP services for robotics applications, edge computing, and distributed systems
* General: Scalable software architectures, application deployment processes, CI/CD automation, unit testing, and all the essential modern development practices

As they say, seeing is believing. Just visit kiwibot.com or robot.com to see the results of my team's and colleagues' work - and by extension, mine. I take pride in leading a part of this journey and building, alongside amazing people, a robotics platform that collectively travels more than 5 times around the Earth each year.

##### The Leader: Learn through victories, and also failures. 

Beyond technical and management skills, I've developed a unique set of leadership capabilities that drive innovation and team success:

* Strategic Vision: Translating complex technical challenges into actionable business strategies
* Cross-functional Collaboration: Bridging the gap between engineering, operations, and business teams
* Innovation Management: Fostering a culture of continuous improvement and cutting-edge development
* Technical Mentorship: Growing the next generation of robotics engineers and AI specialists
* Stakeholder Management: Effectively communicating technical concepts to non-technical audiences
* Risk Management: Balancing innovation with operational safety and reliability
* Resource Optimization: Maximizing team productivity while maintaining high-quality standards
* Crisis Management: Leading teams through technical challenges and operational disruptions
* Technical Decision Making: Making informed choices between competing technical solutions
* Team Scaling: Building and growing high-performing technical teams (Hire is hard as FUCK!)
* Industry Evangelism: Representing the company's technical vision in the robotics community

### What else I have done? 

Here's my journey through almost a decade of innovation, leadership, and technical excellence across diverse projects and industries. 

#### Kiwibot (2018 - Present)
Where my passion for robotics truly took flight. From early-stage development to leading the AI & Robotics department, I've been instrumental in transforming delivery robotics from concept to reality. 

#### RedKraken
A pivotal chapter where I honed my skills in software architecture and team leadership, working on cutting-edge solutions that bridged the gap between technology and real-world applications.

#### SaaS Companies
Where I learned the art of building scalable, user-centric solutions that solve real problems. This experience shaped my approach to creating robust, maintainable systems that stand the test of time.

#### Academic Research
My foundation in robotics and AI was built here, working on projects that pushed the boundaries of what's possible in autonomous systems and machine learning.

#### Academic Training
Sharing knowledge and mentoring the next generation of tech innovators has been one of my most rewarding experiences, helping shape the future of robotics and AI education.

### Estoy bucando algo mas? 

Que ame lo que hago, con lo que los hago y donde lo hago no quiere decir que no este en bsuqueda siempre de mejores cambios y oportunidades. No estoy cerrado a la progreso, pues como la vid amisma estancarse en un solo lugar es morir en la cadena evolutiva, asi que esiempre estare dispuesto a escuchar y explorar oportunidades, iniciativas y negocios en: 

* RObotica en general.
* Autnoamtizacion industrial. 
* Software as a service. 
* Academia.
