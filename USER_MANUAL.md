# How to Work with JohnBetaCode
By: John Betancourt 


## **Why this manual?** 

In my time leading, and managing engineering teams, I realized one of the most important soft skills as a leader is clear, efficient, and right communication with your colleagues, employees, superiors, and other leads. Each one of us is wired slightly differently. Yet most of us behave as if everyone else somehow knows exactly how we operate, and then we get upset when they don’t meet our expectations. So, in this document, I’ll cover the topics that I considered should be clear to have an efficient workflow with me, and I encourage everyone who reads this to make their own and share his/her ideas. 


## **Want do I want to avoid**:

Make decisions based only on our assumptions.
Assume other people should think in a similar way to us.
Expect people to understand our/my needs without verbalizing them.
Become very creative when someone is behaving differently than we would expect.
We want people to remember what’s important to us, even if we mentioned it once years ago.


## **Working hours & Times**:

* 📖 Focus: During working hours, I prefer to focus on work-related things. Chit-chat is not something I enjoy at work. We have workstations and informal team meetings/spaces for that, aka LoL Hands.

* 🕕 Times: I work from Monday to Friday and in exceptional cases Saturdays in the morning. My days start at 5:00 AM every day, and they used to get over around 11:00 PM, but I attend work topics from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. During these times I won't answer any work concerns, except requests from my superiors or other leads. I could work out of this time when I want or I’m bored, I never expect you to do the same.

* 🥪 Lunch: My Lunch is from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM, I do not exist at this time for anybody. I'm very strict with my eating times, and I’m gonna reject any event scheduled at this time
.
* ☕ Breaks: Please block in your agenda, and calendar your rest times such as lunches, cafes, and similar. For me, it’s important to know what times I can count on you. 

* ⭐ Compromises: If you have an appointment of any kind, please block the time in your calendar, and notify me at least one week before, so I can schedule team activities such as 1on1s, project follow-ups, weekly, daily, or other meetings with enough time. 

## **Communication**:

* 🆚 Written vs verbal: I prefer written (i.e. emails, slack, etc..). So, if you want to discuss or want me to do something, I’d encourage you to write to me beforehand. If you are a leader, and there’s an important topic to cover, do it via email.

* 🌐 Synchronous is better: I prefer synchronous communication via Slack. If you got my message, you don’t have to reply instantly. Sometimes you may get my Slack or email message on the weekends or in the late evening. I shared it with you because I just came up with an idea and don’t want to forget it, but I do not expect a reply, on the weekend, on your vacation, and when you are away. Reply when you start your workday. I prefer to avoid asynchronous communication, so please try to be aware of your computer, chats, or even your phone if you are working remotely.

* 📲 Channels: You can reach me out through my personal number at any time if something really bad happens to you, and you can not be at some event, meeting or you can not work normally, even if you have to leave the office or your place to attend other personal, and more important concerns, please let know.

* 📵 The Communication Nopes: If you write to me on my personal WhatsApp, or similar for labor reasons, probably I won't answer, please do not do it at least if you have something really important to communicate, for that, I have a company WhatsApp number, ask for it.  

* 💭 Share Thoughts: I thrive when I talk about the vision and see the bigger picture. I am curious to hear why and how your current tasks are connected with the wider view. I am always willing to invest in long-term solutions and ideas. My job is to connect dots inside and outside the company. If you have any idea what could be improved, what is missing, or what is wrong at the company, please share it with me.

* 🤝 Meetings: Meetings are necessary, and it’s my everyday. What I expect from them is:

    * Having an agenda of topics to discuss, and never improvising, provide this information in the meet event (Zoom or Google Meets) in advance.
Measured the time for every topic. 
    * Cameras are turned on, so people can feel you are focused on the meeting. 
    * Get the points or next steps, compromises, and should be noted in some place, agenda, minutes, notion, email, whatever. 
    * Should not be more than 30 min at least we are covering more than three topics or a big one.
    * If the meeting is more than one hour there should be a 10 minutes break.
    * Get a good setup for meetings, especially if you are remote, this is a good internet connection, god camera, god audio for you, and especially a good microphone.

## **Tasks & Responsibilities**:

* 📄 Tasks: If you get a task, take full responsibility for it. It’s not necessary to update me with every minor detail, I’m more interested in the final result. I really appreciate it when people in my team don’t come to me with questions that they can solve independently and find their own ways to complete the task. However, it does not mean that you should not contact me whenever you feel stuck!

* 💀 Deadlines: I am very punctual. If I tell you I’ll finish by a certain timeframe, trust me, I’ll try my best to live up to that. In return, I expect the same from people. If you are running late, that’s okay. But, you should to tell the reasons before you’re late. The earlier, the better.

* 📝 Clear responsibility: I like tasks to be clearly assigned with a deadline. So, if you want me to do something, please tell me clearly and assign the tasks to me. On the other hand, if you’re assigned to do something, please don’t ask me to do it. I can do it, but you have to have good reasons. I simply can’t handle everything.

* 👀 Presentations: I like to see things visually. If you want to convince me about something, show visual examples from competitors or other successful companies. I value arguments that are based on research and market review (and presented visually).

* ✍️ Documents: I’m systematic when I work alone, but I might get too abstract when talking/writing about different projects. Please ask for specific details, my plans on how to get there and reasons why we should do something. I probably have a document or a plan for my idea.


## **Culture**:

* ⚔️ Conflict Resolutions: It's unavoidable to have conflicts. The way I like to handle conflicts is to have 1:1, align on our common goals, and resolve the conflict. I love feedback. That is the best way for me to grow. So, please tell me any concerns or feedback you have. I expect you to call me out when I'm wrong, and I expect you to be able to defend/debate your choices and reasoning, I like brutal honesty and go straight to the point. Hypocrisy costs me a lot and if something displeases me you will know it.

* 🙅 Argue/Debate: I debate to the end of the world. Unfortunately, people are offended sometimes. So, please don’t take this personally. That’s just typical of me, wanting to find the truth. Flag me if you find this uncomfortable. I’ll stop. 

* 💖 Respect: You have my respect only if you try your best to master your area, you keep learning, and you are an example for others, including me. If you are mediocre in your job, without interest in learning, or growing, I'll let you know this, and probably your opinion won't be valuable to me. I want you to know I don't care how you dress, talk, what you believe or think, your sexual orientation, your political, religious, family, cultural backgrounds, etc.

* 🚫 Tolerance: I tolerate almost everything, except violence, lies, disrespect, workplace or sexual harassment, and direct attacks on someone (Except if we are joking). 

* 🚀 Team values: I'll put the team's interests over my own interests, and yours. Even that means working extra hours to cover for teammates, doing boring work, etc. That's fine as long as the team succeeds.

* 🗣️ Sharing: Chatting about our hobbies, thoughts, weekends or days adds special energy and good vibes, which is necessary to build great things together!”I’ll always accept a coffee break. 

* 🎯 Get to the point: I don't use to say hello at chats when the day is starting, and to be honest if you answer me back I know you are well enough for me (Otherwise please tell). I believe in the economy of words, as soon as you get my message, and I get the answer, it’s better. 

* 😞 Clutter is something I can't tolerate. Clean Your Desk, and your code, keep it documented! 

* 🌱 Life Philosophy, Time & Space for All: I believe in the Master Roshi Philosophy (Yes! From Dragon Ball), I said: No matter how hard you train your body, you cannot call yourself a true martial artist unless you have to train your head as well. For me, this applies also vice versa. You also have to learn well, eat well, rest well, and play well. If you are not giving the right time for each one you are doing badly as well.


## **Other Personal Facts**:

* 🥷 Introvert: In social settings (party, big group, or non-work-related stuff), I am quite an introvert. So, if you see me quiet or act weird, well, that’s probably the introvert me. Although I won’t start the conversation, I certainly welcome one!. I also love hanging out with people in small groups. I’m usually super quiet in a big group.

* 🫂 Social/Work Relations: People often try to not separate personal vs professional life, some people say the best colleagues they have are also their friends outside of work, and the relationship is durable even after they leave the company. But this is not my case, I’m not interested in being your friend, just being a good leader and colleague at work, don’t take that personally. I do not bother if you add me on Facebook or LinkedIn. I care about your personal life if this affects the team or the company.

* 😓 Weaknesses: I have bad memory, so that’s why I take notes of everything, so at the end of the day nothing will escape from me. If you tell me something, and I don't take action immediately or I write it I’ll forget it for sure.
